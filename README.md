The ATLAS (Altered TCR Ligand Affinities and Structures) database is a manually curated repository containing the binding affinities for wild-type and mutant T cell receptors (TCRs) and their antigens, peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The database links experimentally measured binding affinities with the corresponding three dimensional structures for TCR-pMHC complexes. 

The ATLAS git repository houses all the code for the ATLAS site along with a collection of scripts used for prediction of TCR-pMHC binding affinity from ATLAS data.
